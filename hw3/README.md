My name is Nicholas Ronyai, I am a 21 year old Canadian born dual citizen. I went to high school in the Seattle area but returned to Canada for cheap university. After two unsatisfying years of studying radio broadcasting I took an unrelated job for a few years to travel.

While I was traveling with work I had a lot of free time and got into doing a lot of DIY electronics projects with the Arduino and Raspberry pi platforms. Now I'm back in Seattle working at Virginia Mason and trying to learn good Python.

The raspberry pi is a fun educational tool. It can be turned into an enterntainment center, a laptop, a controller for your homemade drone or anything else really. And the pi comes from PYthon. Below is a link to their page.
